# Data Analysis of Life Expectancy
➥ Many studies have been undertaken in the past on the factors affecting a country's life expectancy, taking into account demographic variables, income composition and death rates. It was found that the effect of vaccination and the human development index were not taken into account in the past. Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. This shows that health standards are not the same all over the world. In the 20th century, this global inequality is reduced and similarly, life expectancy is approaching 70 to 75 years and similarly no country in the world today has a low life expectancy than countries with high life expectancy in 1800.

➥ I Used Used Visualization tools & ML models in Python language like matplotlib, seaborn & Tensorflow, keras respectively to visualize (Heatmap, Violon Plot, Scatter Plot, Joint Plot, Bubble Chart) relationships between Life Expectancy and different factors (like GDP, Obesity, Drinking Water Service, etc).

➥ I also used ML models for computing regressions (Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor).
